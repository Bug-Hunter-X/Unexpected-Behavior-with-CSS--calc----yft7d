The main problem with the original CSS is the misuse of calc within a flex context where the parent container's size isn't explicitly defined. Depending on the context (flexbox, grid, etc.), it's crucial to ensure that the parent element's dimensions are established before using `calc()` to subtract from it. If the parent doesn't have a defined width, `calc(100% - 20px)` won't calculate properly.

Here's the solution:

Instead of relying solely on `calc()` to determine the width, set the parent container's width explicitly.  Or, if the parent should naturally fit its contents, ensure that there is a defined width or other constraints on the container's dimensions. 

```css
/*bug.css (incorrect)*/
.container {
  display: flex;
}
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
  background-color: lightblue;
}

/*bugSolution.css (correct)*/
.container {
  display: flex;
  width: 300px; /* or any explicit width */
}
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```
